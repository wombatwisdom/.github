# Wombat Wisdom üê∞üí°
Welcome to Wombat Wisdom, a community-driven organization dedicated to creating and sharing knowledge, components, plugins, and tools around the wombat project.

## What is Wombat?
Wombat is an open-source tool to build data pipelines. It is built on top of [RedPanda Benthos Core](https://github.com/redpanda-data/benthos) and provides components, tools and plugins under a permissive license.

## Our Mission
At Wombat Wisdom, we believe in the power of collaboration and open-source software. Our mission is to create a community-driven ecosystem where developers, engineers, and enthusiasts can come together to share knowledge, ideas, and projects that make our life of dealing with data at least a bit easier.

## Origins
Wombat Wisdom has been created as an answer to the community questioning the aquisition of the project previously known as Benthos. While the Benthos core lives on as `RedPanda Benthos`, a lot of the components which previously existed have been positioned as `RedPanda Connect` with some of these being changed towards a commercial license. We get it, a company needs to be make money and it is a genuine move, but it does have an impact on the community and the ability to experience and contribute to the project:

- the ability to just run the project without having to rely on the new owners ecosystem
- the ability to contribute to the project without the risk of the new owners changing the license at a later point
- free use, with as little restrictions as possible of the project, tools an knowledge

We support RedPanda and the aquisition and hope to work together to have `RedPanda Benthos` reach its full potential. At the same time we want to provide people with options and kickstart an ecosystem that goes beyond a single organization and the perceptions, valid or false, people have.

## How You Can Contribute
If you're interested in contributing to our community, here are some ways you can get started:

* **Submit an issue**: if you've identified a problem or need with the existing components, plugins, or tools, submit an issue on GitHub.
* **Create a pull request**: if you have a fix or enhancement for an existing component, plugin, or tool, create a pull request to contribute your changes.
* **Start a new project**: if you have an idea for a new component, plugin, or tool, start a new project and share it with the community.

## How We'll Work Together
To ensure that contributions are high-quality and consistent with our goals, we'll follow these guidelines:

* **Code style**: use the same coding style as the original wombat project.
* **Testing**: include thorough testing for any new components, plugins, or tools to ensure they work correctly.
* **Documentation**: provide clear and concise documentation for each component, plugin, or tool.

## Getting Started
